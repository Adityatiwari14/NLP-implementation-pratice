# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Practice

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms for practice and experimentation. The goal is to understand, apply, and compare different NLP models on various text-based datasets.

## Project Structure
- Multiple Jupyter Notebooks implementing different NLP techniques and models.
- Each notebook contains code for text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Techniques and Models Implemented

### **Text Preprocessing**
- Tokenization (Word & Sentence)
- Stopword Removal
- Lemmatization & Stemming
- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

### **Feature Engineering**
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

### **Supervised Learning for NLP**
- Sentiment Analysis (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Text Classification (Random Forest, XGBoost)



### **Unsupervised Learning for NLP**
- Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA)
- Text Summarization (Extractive & Abstractive)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy & Transformers
